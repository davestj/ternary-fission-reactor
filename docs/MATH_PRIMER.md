## Base 3 (Ternary)

    - Digits: 0, 1, 2
    - Example addition: 2 + 2 = 11₃
    - Suits three-way energy partitioning in reactor fuel cells.

## Base 5 (Quinary)

    - Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Example multiplication: 3 × 4 = 22₅
    - Models five discrete moderation states for neutron flux control.

## Base 8 (Octal)

    - Digits: 0 through 7
    - Example conversion: 77₁₀ = 115₈
    - Aligns with byte-oriented storage for rapid telemetry mapping.

## Base 17 (Heptadecimal)

    - Digits: 0-9, A-G
    - Example subtraction: 20₁₇ − G₁₇ = 13₁₇
    - Prime base spreads heat-load factors evenly across nodes.

## Energy Distribution Rationale

    - Bases combine so that ternary splitting feeds quinary moderators.
    - Octal mapping packs readings into byte-aligned buffers.
    - Heptadecimal layers prime symmetry over grid routing, minimizing
        resonance and ensuring balanced energy distribution.
