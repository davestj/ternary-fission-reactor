Description: Advanced nuclear physics simulation and modeling software
 The Ternary Fission Reactor is a sophisticated nuclear physics simulation
 platform designed for modeling and analyzing ternary fission processes in
 nuclear reactors. This software provides comprehensive tools for:
 .
  * Ternary fission cross-section calculations
  * Neutron transport modeling
  * Reactor criticality analysis
  * Thermal hydraulics simulation
  * Fuel burnup calculations
  * Safety analysis and accident modeling
 .
 The software is designed for nuclear engineers, physicists, and researchers
 working in nuclear reactor design, safety analysis, and nuclear fuel cycle
 optimization. It features high-performance computing capabilities and
 supports various reactor geometries and fuel types.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Monte Carlo neutron transport simulation
  - Advanced physics models for ternary fission
  - Real-time visualization and plotting
  - Comprehensive data analysis tools
  - Export capabilities for further analysis
 .
 This package includes the main simulation engine, command-line utilities,
 and example configuration files for getting started with reactor modeling.
